# FinalProject
-> Reclaim your ship!


Purpose of the project
-> The main purpose of the final project is to test the ability of the sudent in game programming to see whether or not the student has acquired all the coursework thought this semester by the teacher.

-> In these 15 grueling weeks we had the oppurtunity to work with our collegues (Best Friends) in order to create a game based on the guidelines presented by the teacher.

-> After every couple of days would pass the teacher would do a regular check-in to make sure all students are doing the respected work to be able to deliver all the deliverables before the due date.

-> After the 14th week had passed we had to make sure our game was ready to be shared with our collegues to make our game even better. Then after sharing our code, we had to present our game and our GDD in front of the class to showcase what we were able to deliver.

-> On the 14th of december 2020, we had to deliver the final game for the Gold master and the public to enjoy the game.
